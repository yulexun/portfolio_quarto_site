    "section": "",
    "text": "Ghost in the Shell is a Japanese science fiction movie directed by Oshii (1996) in 1995. It tells a story about a policewomen called Major Motoko Kusanagi investigating a multinational hacking on cyborgs. Major Kusanagi is a cyborg, she has a human brain but an artificial body. The story takes place in a city called New Port city. Major Kusanagi, Batou and the Section 9 team found a hacker called Puppet Master. Puppet Master can hack into people’s brain and manipulate their thoughts. Upon the investigation, Major Motoko realized that the Puppet Master is an Artificial Intelligence created by Section 6 with a code name 2501 which is a project aim to create a new form of artificial life. The hacking event is also related to a series of mysterious murders involving powerful government officials. During Major Motoko’s conversation with Puppet Master, she discovers Puppet master’s true desires. Puppet Master wants to merge with human consciousness and have a true self. Meanwhile, Major Kusanagi was also questioning her humanity. At the end of the movie, when Section 6 hunts down Puppet Master and Kusanagi, they merge their consciousnesses and turn into an AI with consciousness. In the movie, there is a strong connection between the film’s space and geography, and the urban life is a mixture of tradition and modernity. The movie raises the problem in identity of Japanese cities and individuals in cities. The movie is targeted to the masses in Japan which is deeply influenced by modernity.\nIn the book chapter L.A. Noir, Hausladen and Starrs (2005) analyze the relationship between the characters and plots of film noir and Los Angeles as a city. The same film space connection can be found in the Ghost in the Shell. According to Manny Farber, The three types of film space are “(1) the field of the screen, (2) the psychological space of the actor, and (3) the area of experience and geography that the film covers (Hausladen & Starrs, 2005, p. 43).” Hausladen and Starrs argued that environmental determinism has a profound effect on the medium of movie. There is a strong connection between the city that serves as the setting for the story and the psychological space of the characters. The characters in the movies are shaped by the environment they live in. For instance, “dingy alleys and awful days and wicked dialogue and disconsolate weather all presumably added up to damp, if not dyspeptic, souls, (Hausladen and Starrs 2005, 47)” according to Hausladen and Starrs. This effect of environmental determinism can also be found in Ghost in the Shell.\nThe film’s Hong Kong-like urban environment influences the characters in the movie. The story of Ghost in the Shell happens in the cyberpunk future. But this futuristic city isn’t exactly glamorous. People are transformed into partial machines to different extents. At the beginning of the movie, Kusanagi wakes up from a neat room and carries out her mission with high-tech equipment such as optical camouflage. For the average citizens, their bodies have undergone fewer modifications. Government workers are also better equipped and have a better living environment. Average people live in dirty and dim alleys, the buildings in these areas are very old and the roads are badly damaged (Oshii 1996).\nHowever, these people of different incomes and social classes live in the same city and are oblivious to each other. This depiction of the environment defines all characters’ psychological space. The city in this movie shares numerous similarities to Hong Kong, as many of the signs in the show have traditional Chinese characters on them. Yuen (2000) analyzed the close relation between social space and identity in Hong Kong in the article On the Edge of Spaces. The Times Square is the busiest district in Hong Kong. It is a blend of old and new architecture. New commercialized buildings are built in neighborhoods of old buildings inhabited by people with low incomes. There are a lot of empty shots in the movie of the crumbling landscapes of the city, new billboards and stores are opening between these old buildings, which matches Yuen’s description of Hong Kong. The effect of this landscape is a harmonious environment for people of different income and races to live in. This postmodern environment is a very different one from the one depicted in American film noir. According to Yuen, “More than Disneyland, … this absolute accessibility to the fairyland of diversity and display accounts for its success. (Yuen 2000, 6)” This is the opposite of the deliberate urban landscape in the United States, where separate people from each other. Like the city, people are changed to cyborgs, modified by new technologies, and human body parts co-exist with machines.\nThis mixture of old and new buildings in the city and of people and machines in the city represents the attitude of Japanese people towards modernization after war. Modernity in Japan is a contentious issue that has been discussed for many years. It centers on the issue of how Japan should accept modernization and adapt to it, particularly considering the country’s quick transformation during the Meiji Restoration and later decades. Modernist such as Otsuka Hisao encouraged Japanese people to embrace civilization and enlightenment (Koschmann 1981, 625).\nAmong them were also those who championed traditional Japanese culture, such as Yanagita (2008). Yanagita wrote Legend of Tono in 1910, chronicled the legend of a Japanese village called Tono, and Yanagita also pointed out in Preface that Japanese people should find their identity in the Japanese countryside, where traditions exists (Yanagita 2008, 7). About 40 years before the release of Ghost in the Shell, the destruction of Tokyo by a monster (Honda 1954) in Godzilla reflects Japan’s fear of modernization and the United States (Noriega 1987, 61).\nGhost in the Shell demonstrates an alternative way of being for modernization and tradition. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, The new building is built on top of the old one, where traditional human body parts and machines exist in the same body at the same time. This movie uncovered Japan’s new relationship with modernity. Japan has incorporated modernity and grafted it atop already-existing traditions. Modernity’s glamour has entered popular culture in cities, while tradition remains in the shadows. A wide array of signs and cluttered spaces exists everywhere, the sounds of cars, crowds and markets in the city force their way into the ears of every urban resident. In the movie, the inhabitants of the city are completely unresponsive to the sight of a landscape heavily impacted by modernity and a Kusanagi that has been nearly completely transformed by machines. As Yuen mentioned, “the artificial has replaced the natural, humans are like animals in the past, deprived of the characteristics of being human as a whole … their feelings are henceforth numbed (Yuen 2000, 14).” Both the city and citizens are used to this intrusion of modernity. Therefore, at this time, the Japanese in the city did not have a complete acceptance or a complete rejection of modernity. Modernity was integrated into the city, among the Japanese, creating a kind of numbness. Japan’s national identity has become part of modernity, “like one of the silky threads of the spider web (Yuen 2000, 14).”\nThe intended audiences of Ghost in the Shell should be Japanese people in the cities. As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, The overexposed modernity creates a sense of numbness for those living in the city. In one of the movie’s scenes, As Kusanagi makes her way through the city, she sees a person in a window that looks just like herself. Later, Kusanagi and Batou exchange words on a boat outside of town. Kusanagi begins to question who she is herself. She was questioning what a person is consciousness and identity is. Kusanagi’s struggles with the mechanical and human aspects of her body are simultaneously Japanese struggles with their own identity. After experiencing war, atomic war, occupation by the US and “overcoming modernity”, Japan as a nation has incorporated modernity into itself. The examination of the city through the lens of Kusanagi in the movie provides a new perspective for Japanese people. makes Japanese people re-examine Japan’s identity from a third person’s perspective.\nIn conclusion, Japan’s urban environment combines traditional and modern aspects. The issue of identity is examined in relation to Japanese cities and the inhabitants of them. The Japanese populace, which is strongly influenced by modernity, makes up its main audience.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHausladen, Gary J., and Paul F. Starrs. 2005. “L.A.

    "text": "Scopes, Lexical Scoping\nThe Odin Project (n.d.) defines scope as the current context of a variable. When a variable is not declared within any functions, existing outside any { curly braces }, they are said to be in the global scope, meaning that they are available everywhere. If they are within a function or { curly braces }, they are known to be locally scoped.\nWhen any function is run, the function only cares about the scope in which it was defined. I understand this as lexical scoping. This is mentioned in this article by Wes Bos (n.d.).\nMoreover, var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped (scoped in {}). const cannot be reassigned, let can be reassigned.\nThese are very clearly demonstrated in TOP’s sample:\nlet globalAge = 23; // This is a global variable\n// This is a function - and hey, a curly brace indicating a block\nfunction printAge (age) {\n  var varAge = 34; // This is a function scoped variable\n// This is yet another curly brace, and thus a block\n  if (age &gt; 0) {\n    // This is a block-scoped variable that exists\n    // within its nearest enclosing block, the if's block\n    const constAge = age * 2;\n    console.log(constAge);\n  }\n// ERROR! We tried to access a block scoped variable\n  // not within its scope\n  console.log(constAge);\n}\nprintAge(globalAge);\n// ERROR! We tried to access a function scoped variable\n// outside the function it's defined in\nconsole.log(varAge);"

    "section": "Closure and Scope Chain in JavaScript",
    "text": "Closure and Scope Chain in JavaScript\nFunctions in JavaScript form closures. A closure refers to the combination of a function and the surrounding state in which the function was declared. This surrounding state, also called its lexical environment, consists of any local variables that were in scope at the time the closure was made. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: makeAdding() example\n\n\n\nHere, add5 is a reference to the resulting function, created when the makeAdding function is executed, thus it has access to the lexical environment of the resulting function, which contains the first variable, making it available for use. The first variable is stored inside the Scope[0] closure with the returned function assigned to add5, on top of the Global scope.\nSo I came up with another understanding of closure, which is the ability to access a parent level scope from a child scope, even after the parent function has been terminated. The closure keeps its state between calls.\nI asked GPT to generate another example for me, so I am able to examine the variables at the deeper level in the call stack easier literally. Here is the example and the call stack of the inner function when innerFn() ran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nIn this example, the outerVar exists in the scope before the function is called, just like the previous example. When the execution enters the inner function, the outerVar is stored in the Closure, and innerVar is stored in local as shown on the left side of Figure 2.\n\nNesting the Scopes\nThe closure process can be nested. Here is another code snipet created by GPT. You can have functions returning functions at multiple levels, and each inner function will “remember” all the variables from its own scope and all outer scopes up the chain. (but only when the outer variables are actually used)\nfunction outer(a) {\n  return function middle(b) {\n    return function inner(c) {\n      return a + b + c;\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nconst f = outer(1);      // returns middle, remembers a=1\nconst g = f(2);          // returns inner, remembers b=2\nconsole.log(g(3));       // 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\nThe scope of the inner and middle function is shown in Figure 3. I also drawn the hypothetical layers of local, closure and global variable according to my understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3"

    "section": "The this Keyword and Context",
    "text": "The this Keyword and Context\nBut what if I want to access variables outside the defined function scope and its outer scope? This is where the this keyword comes in. this refers to the object that owns the function or method currently being executed. When you call a method on an object, this will refer to that object.\nYou can also explicitly set which object this refers to by using methods like .call(), .apply(), or .bind(). This allows you to control the context in which a function executes. Take this as an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\nIn JavaScript, the value of this inside a function is determined by how the function is called, not where it is defined. When you access this.name inside the returned function, JavaScript looks at the current value of this and tries to find a name property on that object.\n\nWhen you call person.greet(\"Alice\"), JavaScript sets this to the person object because greet is called as a method of person. So, this.name is person.name, which is “Bob”.\nThe object person is transferred into the local variables section of the greeter function, marked as this in Figure 4. Under the this object in local variable, there is a name = 'Bob'.\n\n\nExploring Shadowing\nfunction createGreeter(greeting) {\n  let name = \"default\";\n  return function() {\n    console.log(name);\n    name = \"defaultname\";\n    return `${greeting}, ${name} (this.name: ${this.name})`;\n  };\n}\n\nconst greeter = createGreeter(\"Hello\");\nconst person = { name: \"Bob\", greet: greeter };\nconsole.log(person.greet(\"Alice\")); // \"Hello, defaultname (this.name: Bob)\"\nIn this example, there are two different variables named name, and this demonstrates the concept of shadowing:\n\nThe first is the local variable let name = \"default\"; inside createGreeter. This variable is only accessible within the closure created by createGreeter and its returned function. It is updated to \"defaultname\" after the first call.\nThe second is the name property on the person object (person.name = \"Bob\"), which is accessed via this.name inside the returned function.\n\nWhen you call person.greet(\"Alice\"), inside the function:\n\nname refers to the local variable, which starts as \"default\" and is then changed to \"defaultname\".\nthis.name refers to the property of the object that is the current this context, which is person, so this.name is \"Bob\".\n\nAlthough the name is confusing, now we have two things, a variable name = 'defaultname' shadowing the ‘default’ name in the createGreeter function, and an object this with a name = 'Bob' variable. So the output becomes \"Hello, defaultname (this.name: Bob)\"."

    "title": "Case Study: Media Ethic Analysis of John Naughton’s AI Cheating Article",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On August 24, 2024, the professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University John Naughton published an article “AI cheating is overwhelming the education system – but teachers shouldn’t despair” on The Guardian News website (Naughton 2024). In the comment section of this article, we see both agreement and disagreement. For instance, A user named “convent” agrees with the authors’ viewpoint on the value of human-written paper, while another user named “JohnHLister” criticized the authors’ view as Luddite. In this case study, we aim to analyze the media ethics of John Naughton’s article using Potter Box developed by Ralph B. Potter (Christians et al. 2020, 4). The rest of the case study is structured as follows. First, we define the four matrices of Potter Box as referenced in Figure 1 (Definition, Values, Principles and Loyalties). Second, we extract the definitions and values in the AI cheating case defined by the article, then validate the facts in definitions, as well as comparing the values from different parties. Third, we choose the Judeo-Christian’s principle of agape and loyalties of the public. Finally, based on the ethical principles and loyalties of our choice, we analyze John Naughton’s claims and analyze if the claims match ethical standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Potter Box\n\n\n\nThe Potter Box contains four dimensions: Definition, Values, Principles and Loyalties. According to Clifford G. Christians, Potter Box is used from one quadrant to the next, and the action guide is determined at the final stage (2020, 5). We first give definitions of the situation, citing enough details and facts provided by the author related to the article’s main argument. Second, we determine the values beneath the facts, citing the values that might be important. We then choose the most credible ethical principles based on the social environment of the target audience at quadrant 3, and loyalty at quadrant 4 based on the Guardian’s core purpose and values.\nJohn Naughton’s article discusses the challenges of large language model’s harm on education system, especially in humanities disciplines. The core challenge is the absurdism AI tools created where teachers struggle to distinguish between student and AI-generated works. In the definition quadrant, we identify six facts John mentioned. 1. AI cheating is getting popular. 2. A university professor states that the AI usage makes teachers struggle when grading. 3. OpenAI intentionally hides the tool used for AI essay detection, and this decision infuriates academia that expect a technical product to fix the “cheating” problem. 4. Researchers have concluded that software detecting output of AI systems accurately is not possible now. 5. AI is “cultural technologies” for human augmentation not replacement. 6. Universities are not noticing the threat of technologies in the education system. Among the six definitions, fact 2, and 5 have appropriate hyperlinks to the related articles or publications. For instance, fact 5 is based on a talk by a researcher at Harvard University, Alison Gopnik explains AI as a tool to summary and transmission of human knowledge in her talk between 00:00:45 to 00:03:00 (2024). Peer-reviewed articles validate the challenges in AI detection and watermarking systems discussed in fact four, but John does not provide a reputable source. For example, Elkhatat’s research in 2023 confirms John’s argument that the detection tools shows inaccurate results (2023, 14). The popularity of the AI cheating topic in fact 1 is confirmed by Google (n.d.), as shown in Figure 2. Fact 1 and 6 cannot be validated and the facts are not expressed neutrally. As of fact 1, The article mentions “This refusal [from OpenAI] infuriates those sectors of academia (2024).” John does not state who expressed the infuriation from which sectors of academia. As of fact six, John also did not cite the source of information, as the article only mentions the opinion from “every UK vice-chancellor or senior university administrator I [the author] met” instead of a specific person from the system. As a result, we do not have enough evidence to agree with these facts or definitions. In summary, the definitions in the article can mostly be validated. However, we find two facts not trustworthy, causing less reputation to John’s argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Google Trend on keyword “AI Cheating”\n\n\n\nIn the second stage of Potter Box, we identified three major values in this short article. The three parties involved in the situation are OpenAI, students using AI tools and educators who are grading students. The values in Potter Box motivate actions (Christians et al. 2020, 6). We summarize four values from the related parties. From OpenAI’s perspective, they attach to their commercial values. OpenAI sells their AI LLMs as subscription. Students in higher education is one of the largest customer groups for OpenAI. Releasing dedicated tools for educators to detect AI usage will significantly decrease their revenue. There is also compassion for students. In the US and UK, students pay for their tuition fees in higher education. For students, their goal is to both practice their writing skills and get a degree. However, getting the degree has a higher priority because that may be directly related to their future jobs, or they depend on student loans. The third value is the educator’s value. For educators, writing as an intellectual activity helps students think and develop arguments. Writing with LLMs makes students shift writing from the process to the final product which is bad for their learning.\nAs Christians stated in the introduction to Potter Box, “there is no one theory can satisfactorily resolve all the questions and dilemmas in media ethics (Christians et al. 2020, 13).” We must choose the most proper theory for the audience and the parties mentioned in the article. In this case study, we choose Judeo-Christian’s principle of agape as the ethical principle. The Guardian newspaper is from the UK, we assume there is a considerable number of subscribers and readers in its country of origin. In the article John writes, John frequently quotes researchers and educators in the US for their opinions. The article is in the international version of The Guardian. We also assume a considerable number of target audiences located in the US. In both regions, Christian ethical standards are dominant. According to PRRI’s research in the US, at least 50% of people are Christians (2023). In the UK, 46.2% of the population report Christian (Office for National Statistics 2022). Because of this, we choose the agape as the ethical principle. Agape encourages acceptance of other people’s existence. Love does not estimate the rights and then determines one’s merits attention. John’s article explains the harms of using AI tools in higher education, which shows his caring for teachers for their good intentions to warn students about the dangers of AI cheating. He also shows his love for the students and the concern that students will not be able to improve themselves. To match with the ethical standards, John could improve the organization of his article and show more compassion for the students, as it overlooks the perspective of students who resort to AI cheating due to a lack of time and effort to fully engage in the learning process.\nBecause of the slight bias John presents in the values under agape, John’s loyalty does not fully match ethical standards. As a journalist, John Naughton has loyalty to the employer, themselves, and the public. John successfully demonstrates his loyalty to the employer, which is The Guardian and Open University. John has cited most of the sources in his article, demonstrating a commitment to journalistic integrity and accountability. This approach reflects loyalty to his employer, The Guardian, by upholding its reputation as a credible and reliable news outlet. This also shows loyalty to the public, ensuring they receive accurate and truthful information. He also demonstrates loyalty to the university by addressing the concerns of teachers regarding the issue of AI cheating. By speaking on behalf of the teachers, Naughton aligns his argument with the interests of his coworkers. At the end of the article, John criticized the universities’ administration, prioritizing his loyalty to the public over his loyalty to his employer. However, John falls short in terms of the loyalty to himself, as he brings careerism into his article by using biased phrases such as “infuriate” without proper reference. He also failed to show compassion for the values other than the teachers, who act out of his own self-interest.\nOverall, John fairly presents the definitions and values of different parties, and it meets with the basic ethical standards. However, the article would benefit from greater neutrality and balanced representation of all stakeholders. If John provides a more comprehensive demonstration of compassion and fairness to parties other than teachers, it will align fully with the ethical standards it aims to uphold.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChristians, Clifford G., Mark Fackler, Kathy Brittain McKee, and Peggy J.
