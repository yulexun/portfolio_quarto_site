  abstract = {Abstract             The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, particularly from models like ChatGPT, presents potential challenges to academic integrity and raises concerns about plagiarism. This study investigates the capabilities of various AI content detection tools in discerning human and AI-authored content. Fifteen paragraphs each from ChatGPT Models 3.5 and 4 on the topic of cooling towers in the engineering process and five human-witten control responses were generated for evaluation. AI content detection tools developed by OpenAI, Writer, Copyleaks, GPTZero, and CrossPlag were used to evaluate these paragraphs. Findings reveal that the AI detection tools were more accurate in identifying content generated by GPT 3.5 than GPT 4. However, when applied to human-written control responses, the tools exhibited inconsistencies, producing false positives and uncertain classifications. This study underscores the need for further development and refinement of AI content detection tools as AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated and harder to distinguish from human-written text.},

  abstract = {Alison Gopnik from University of California, Berkeley joined the Kempner's Seminar Series on May 31, 2024 to discuss: "Transmission Versus Truth: AI Models as Cultural Technologies and Epistemic Agents." Many approaches to AI assume that there is a single ``general intelligence'' which AI systems should maximize. I argue instead that there are multiple conflicting intelligences which trade-off against each other. In particular, there is a contrast between discovering the truth about the world and transmitting that information to other agents. LLM's are extremely effective cultural technologies, analogous to writing, print or internet search. They summarize and transmit information that humans have already learned but they are not designed to recover the structure of the external world. In contrast, children are extremely effective truth-seeking agents, exploring and experimenting. I suggest that recent intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning agents are a  better model for the truth-seeking we see in children. In particular, I argue that RL systems that use ``empowerment gain'' as an intrinsic reward, seeking actions that lead to predictable outcomes, might be an important mechanism for the causal learning that is key to children's everyday theory formation. I will report some recent empirical work along these lines comparing how children and AI agents explore in virtual environments.
